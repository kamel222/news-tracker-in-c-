Snapchat Launches New Holiday Season Guide and Resource Hub to Assist With Campaign Planning:


It still feels too early to be planning for the holiday shopping rush, but according to Snapchat,
 it most definitely is not, which is why this week, it's launched its new holiday resource hub for marketers, 
providing insight into key trends and behaviors that businesses need to note within their planning.


The main element of Snap's new holiday hub is an 8-page guide to key trends, 
which documents largely the same data as presented in the above video clip.

As Snap notes, the key impetus of the early publication of the guide is to help businesses get to planning, 
with Snap advising that marketers should look to launch their holiday campaigns in October, 
when interest begins to rise.
