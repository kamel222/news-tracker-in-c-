Facebook Delays Taking a Cut on Paid Events and Fan Subscriptions till 2023:


Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is not happy with Apple, 
and he's not afraid to call them out by name in airing his grievances.


As you can see here, Zuckerberg has today announced that its creator revenue tools, including paid online events, 
fan subscriptions and badges, will remain free for creators to use up until 2023.

Facebook announced that these tools would be free on launch last year, 
with the understanding that this was a measure put in place to help those impacted by the pandemic, 
and that Facebook would, eventually, look to take a cut of these paid tools as part of its future revenue strategy.

Which is still the case, but given the ongoing impacts of the pandemic, 
Facebook's keeping them free for now, 
while Zuck has also directly called out Apple's 30% fee for in-app subscriptions on iOS, 
noting that Facebook won't be so greedy in its eventual revenue share strategy.

Tensions have been simmering between the tech giants since last June, when Apple announced its coming IDFA update, 
which would alert all app users to the data that each app tracks on them, via prominent pop-ups on screen. 
The prompts then give users the capacity to block data tracking, limiting the insight available for digital advertisers.
