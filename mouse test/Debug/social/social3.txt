LinkedIn Provides New Insights into Key Learning and Development Trends:


LinkedIn has this week published its fifth Workplace Learning Report, 
which incorporates responses from over 1,200 learning and development professionals, 
and nearly 900 learners, to provide some fresh perspective and insight into key learning and upskilling trends, 
and how businesses should be planning for these developments.

You can download the full, 65-page report here (with email sign-up), 
but in this post, we'll take a look at some of the key notes.

First off, in what will come as no surprise given the chaos that was 2020, 
LinkedIn found that 'Resilience and Adaptability' is now a key learning and development focus, 
with 'Technology Skills/Digital Fluency' coming in second.

We all needed to adapt, in some way, due to the impacts of the pandemic, and you can see, based on these other topics, 
the influence that the WFH shift has had on development trends.

The increased focus on digital connectivity has also made digital literacy a key focus.

Really, digital literacy should now be on the general education curriculum, as it already is in some nations. 
Considering the broader impacts of misinformation, and how digital platforms can be used to facilitate such, 
and our increasing reliance on connected tools in all aspects, 
it's arguably now a critical life skill that all youngsters are learning themselves anyway.

The more information we can provide on this, the better.

LinkedIn also found that 'Upskilling and reskilling' is now the key focus area for learning and development programs, 
which also comes as little surprise.
