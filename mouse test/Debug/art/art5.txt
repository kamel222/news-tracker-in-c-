20th Century Women Artists Challenging Conventions In Britain – Revd Jonathan Evens:


The twentieth century was a time of great change for women. Those born, raised and educated in the 19th century, 
then forming relationships and working in the 20th century saw extraordinary progress. 
But against that backdrop was their struggle to challenge the conventions imposed upon them by a patriarchal society.

This exhibition spotlights four British artists working in the early 1900s – Vanessa Bell, Gwen John, 
Laura Knight and Dod Procter- to explore their lives and work in a climate of modernism, 
transformation and increasing emancipation. 
They were all born towards the end of the 19th century and were each determined to pursue their art, 
seizing the opportunity to enter art school and to exhibit their work within a changing society as the 20th century dawned.
Each established a successful career at a time when there had been few celebrated women artists.

The exhibition reveals how these women challenged the conventions of their day to become respected painters, 
while showcasing each as an important artist in her own right. 
Laura Knight became the first elected female Academician in 1936. As Knight herself commented, 
a lack of opportunity had held women back. But in 1930 she wrote: ‘at last they are having their chance.’
