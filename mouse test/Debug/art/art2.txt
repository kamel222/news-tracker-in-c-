Robert E. Lee’s former Virginia mansion reopens to the public with an enlightening focus on the enslaved:


Arlington House, the Virginia mansion best known as the onetime home of the Confederate general Robert E. Lee, 
has reopened to the public after a $12.3m restoration 
and the introduction of a new narrative that illuminates the lives of the enslaved people who lived there.

“Visitors are encouraged to come to the space and challenge what you to know to be true” about the nation’s painful history,
says Aaron LaRocca, a park ranger who is chief of staff for the George Washington Memorial Parkway, 
the National Park Service (NPS) unit that manages the house. 
“The hope is that you’ll have discussions around the dinner table about what you have learned.”

In one of the largest curatorial projects ever overseen by the park service, he says, 
the NPS has purchased 1,300 objects for display, 
many of which relate to the experiences of roughly 100 slaves who lived at Arlington House over the decades 
in addition to around a dozen white people. 
LaRocca says the NPS has a relationship with some of the descendants of those Black individuals, 
which opened the way for acquisitions as well as loans. He says that around 1,000 objects have also been conserved.

The house, which overlooks Arlington National Cemetery, 
was built from 1802 to 1818 by slaves and hired craftsmen on a 1,100-acre plantation owned by George Washington
His father was the stepson of George Washington, 
and Custis intended the mansion to be a tribute of sorts to the first president. 
Lee came to own the house after marrying Custis’s daughter Mary Anna in 1831, 
three decades before he would resign from the US Army in response his native Virginia’s secession from the United States.
