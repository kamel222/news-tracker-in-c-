Sotheby's owner Patrick Drahi buys £2.2bn majority stake in BT:


Altice, the telecommunications giant headed-up by the Sotheby's owner Patrick Drahi, 
has bought a majority 12.1% stake in BT for around £2.2bn, 
an announcement that caused the telecoms giant's stock price to surge by 5% this morning.

The French-Israeli billionaire, known for his cost-cutting approach, 
has officially stated that he "does not intend to make a takeover offer for BT" 
but supports BT's fibre broadband rollout programme across the UK, estimated to cost £12bn.

Altice already has set up national fibre and mobile networks in the US, France, Portugal . 
Altice UK, a separate company, was established by Drahi specifically in order to hold the 1.2 billion BT shares. 
It now outranks Deutsche Telekom, a 12% shareholder.

Drahi is no stranger to debt, 
with a reputation for aggressive deal-making followed by equally aggressive cost-cutting. 
But the Luxembourg-based company Altice has been quieter on the acquisitions front for the past two years ,
since Drahi bought Sotheby’s for around $3.7bn in 2019, 
taking on $1bn of debt in the process. 
Four Sotheby's shareholders attempted to sue the auction house in order to block the takeover 
but the deal was ultimately approved.

"BT has a significant opportunity to upgrade and extend its full-fibre broadband network to bring substantial benefits 
to millions of households across the UK. We fully support the management's strategy to deliver on this opportunity,
" Drahi says in a statement. 
"We understand that the expansion of the broadband network is one of the UK Government's most important policy objectives
and a core part of its levelling up agenda."

In response to the announcement, 
says: "We welcome all investors who recognise the long-term value of business and the important role it plays in the UK."
