The African figures 'forgotten' by England's cultural past:


Painting our Past: The African Diaspora in England draws together new portraits of six historical figures - 
spanning Roman Britain to the 20th Century - that reflect the long history of African people in England.

The figures include Septimius Severus, an African-born Roman emperor who strengthened Hadrian's Wall, 
and James Chappell, a black 17th Century servant at Kirby Hall in Northamptonshire who saved the life of the then owner, 
Sir Christopher Hatton.

The paintings are on display at the English Heritage-linked forts, abbeys, 
historic houses and barracks where these individuals lived, visited or worked. 
This includes the return of the portrait of Sarah Forbes Bonetta, Queen Victoria's African goddaughter, 
to Osborne House, Victoria's seaside home on the Isle of Wight.

Anna Eavis, English Heritage's curatorial director, 
said: "African figures from the past have played significant roles at some of the historic sites in our care 
but many of their stories are not very well known.

"Placing their portraits on the walls of those sites is one way we hope to bring their stories to life 
and share them with a wider audience."

The exhibition's new portraits have all been commissioned from artists who themselves identify as black or mixed-heritage
