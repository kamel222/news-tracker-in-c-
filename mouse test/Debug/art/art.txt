Sotheby's owner Patrick Drahi buys £2.2bn majority stake in BT:


Altice, the telecommunications giant headed-up by the Sotheby's owner Patrick Drahi, 
has bought a majority 12.1% stake in BT for around £2.2bn, 
an announcement that caused the telecoms giant's stock price to surge by 5% this morning.

The French-Israeli billionaire, known for his cost-cutting approach, 
has officially stated that he "does not intend to make a takeover offer for BT" 
but supports BT's fibre broadband rollout programme across the UK, estimated to cost £12bn.

Altice already has set up national fibre and mobile networks in the US, France, Portugal . 
Altice UK, a separate company, was established by Drahi specifically in order to hold the 1.2 billion BT shares. 
It now outranks Deutsche Telekom, a 12% shareholder.

Drahi is no stranger to debt, 
with a reputation for aggressive deal-making followed by equally aggressive cost-cutting. 
But the Luxembourg-based company Altice has been quieter on the acquisitions front for the past two years ,
since Drahi bought Sotheby’s for around $3.7bn in 2019, 
taking on $1bn of debt in the process. 
Four Sotheby's shareholders attempted to sue the auction house in order to block the takeover 
but the deal was ultimately approved.

"BT has a significant opportunity to upgrade and extend its full-fibre broadband network to bring substantial benefits 
to millions of households across the UK. We fully support the management's strategy to deliver on this opportunity,
" Drahi says in a statement. 
"We understand that the expansion of the broadband network is one of the UK Government's most important policy objectives
and a core part of its levelling up agenda."

In response to the announcement, 
says: "We welcome all investors who recognise the long-term value of business and the important role it plays in the UK."

Robert E. Lee’s former Virginia mansion reopens to the public with an enlightening focus on the enslaved:


Arlington House, the Virginia mansion best known as the onetime home of the Confederate general Robert E. Lee, 
has reopened to the public after a $12.3m restoration 
and the introduction of a new narrative that illuminates the lives of the enslaved people who lived there.

“Visitors are encouraged to come to the space and challenge what you to know to be true” about the nation’s painful history,
says Aaron LaRocca, a park ranger who is chief of staff for the George Washington Memorial Parkway, 
the National Park Service (NPS) unit that manages the house. 
“The hope is that you’ll have discussions around the dinner table about what you have learned.”

In one of the largest curatorial projects ever overseen by the park service, he says, 
the NPS has purchased 1,300 objects for display, 
many of which relate to the experiences of roughly 100 slaves who lived at Arlington House over the decades 
in addition to around a dozen white people. 
LaRocca says the NPS has a relationship with some of the descendants of those Black individuals, 
which opened the way for acquisitions as well as loans. He says that around 1,000 objects have also been conserved.

The house, which overlooks Arlington National Cemetery, 
was built from 1802 to 1818 by slaves and hired craftsmen on a 1,100-acre plantation owned by George Washington
His father was the stepson of George Washington, 
and Custis intended the mansion to be a tribute of sorts to the first president. 
Lee came to own the house after marrying Custis’s daughter Mary Anna in 1831, 
three decades before he would resign from the US Army in response his native Virginia’s secession from the United States.

Amazon's plans to build massive warehouse near Roman aqueduct in south of France cause concern:


The online retail giant through its business partner Argan was granted a building permit for a 38,000 sq.m warehouse by
the village of Fournès three years ago. The warehouse will be located less than 5km from the ancient bridge Pont du Gard.

The mayor of Fournès, Thierry Boudinaud, who was then deputy mayor, 
says that the council was unaware that Amazon was behind the project.

A local association, Adere, which was set up by locals opposed to the warehouse, 
is seeking to block the construction. Over 35,000 people have signed its online petition, 
‘Say No to Amazon at the Pont du Gard!’ on Change.org. Several ‘Stop Amazon’ protests have taken place; 
the most recent one in May was attended by over 100 activists. At another protest, banners were draped over the aqueduct.

Adere claims that the warehouse will be like a “wart” along the route that is taken by 90% of tourists heading to the Unesco
heritage site. The group fears that the landscape, agriculture, vineyards, beekeeping, biodiversity, 
tourism and local businesses will be affected by the new warehouse.

Last August, Corinne Lepage, Adere’s lawyer, filed a “contentious appeal” against the development at a court in Nîmes. 
A judicial enquiry was also launched this January into a complaint alleging a conflict of interest over 
how local councillors (including Boudinaud) and their relatives sold the land. 
“This project is marred in irregularities, which could invalidate it,” the association says about the ongoing court case.

The French politician, Delphine Batho, 
proposed a bill in parliament last summer to place a moratorium on Amazon setting up new warehouses 
as well as emergency measures to protect local businesses from competition from the retail giant.

In a statement sent to The Art Newspaper, 
Unesco says it has “warned the French authorities of the concerns of civil society, 
relating to the establishment of a warehouse possibly leased to the company Amazon, 
under [article] 4 of [Unesco’s] Convention, 
according to which the protection of heritage is primarily the responsibility of the State Party in which it is located.”

The statement further suggests that Unesco has raised the issue of the planned warehouse’s proximity to the Pont du Gard 
and how appreciation of the site might be impacted: 
“Unesco has taken note of the answers from France confirming that the area concerned is 
located outside the Pont du Gard’s buffer zone and that the 
co-visibility of the project with the World Heritage property could not be established. 
Although not impacting the universal value of the Pont du Gard property, 
Unesco and the French authorities remain attentive to this project given the attention it is attracting.”

Amazon, which is developing several other sites in France, argues that it will be creating 150 jobs in the Fournès area.

French President Emmanuel Macron met Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s founder, 
at the Elysée palace in Paris in February 2020 and is supportive of the group’s expansion in France.

The African figures 'forgotten' by England's cultural past:


Painting our Past: The African Diaspora in England draws together new portraits of six historical figures - 
spanning Roman Britain to the 20th Century - that reflect the long history of African people in England.

The figures include Septimius Severus, an African-born Roman emperor who strengthened Hadrian's Wall, 
and James Chappell, a black 17th Century servant at Kirby Hall in Northamptonshire who saved the life of the then owner, 
Sir Christopher Hatton.

The paintings are on display at the English Heritage-linked forts, abbeys, 
historic houses and barracks where these individuals lived, visited or worked. 
This includes the return of the portrait of Sarah Forbes Bonetta, Queen Victoria's African goddaughter, 
to Osborne House, Victoria's seaside home on the Isle of Wight.

Anna Eavis, English Heritage's curatorial director, 
said: "African figures from the past have played significant roles at some of the historic sites in our care 
but many of their stories are not very well known.

"Placing their portraits on the walls of those sites is one way we hope to bring their stories to life 
and share them with a wider audience."

The exhibition's new portraits have all been commissioned from artists who themselves identify as black or mixed-heritage 
- read on to learn about their subject's stories.

20th Century Women Artists Challenging Conventions In Britain – Revd Jonathan Evens:


The twentieth century was a time of great change for women. Those born, raised and educated in the 19th century, 
then forming relationships and working in the 20th century saw extraordinary progress. 
But against that backdrop was their struggle to challenge the conventions imposed upon them by a patriarchal society.

This exhibition spotlights four British artists working in the early 1900s – Vanessa Bell, Gwen John, 
Laura Knight and Dod Procter- to explore their lives and work in a climate of modernism, 
transformation and increasing emancipation. 
They were all born towards the end of the 19th century and were each determined to pursue their art, 
seizing the opportunity to enter art school and to exhibit their work within a changing society as the 20th century dawned.
Each established a successful career at a time when there had been few celebrated women artists.

The exhibition reveals how these women challenged the conventions of their day to become respected painters, 
while showcasing each as an important artist in her own right. 
Laura Knight became the first elected female Academician in 1936. As Knight herself commented, 
a lack of opportunity had held women back. But in 1930 she wrote: ‘at last they are having their chance.’
