Al Ahly defeat RS Berkane, win CAF Super Cup title

CAIRO-28 May 2021: Al Ahly, 2020 CAF Champions League winners, defeated Morocco's RS Berkane, 
CAF Confederation Cup winners, 2-1 on Friday to win the CAF Super Cup title. 

Al Ahly secured their victory with two second-half goals by Mohamed Sherif 
and Salah Mohsen after the first half ended in a goalless draw. 
 
The Red Devils won their 7th CAF Super Cup title in the history, 
extending their record as the club with the most CAF Super Cup titles in the history. 

Sherif broke the deadlock in the game with a fantastic shot from inside the opponent's box while Salah Mohsen
doubled the score, 8 minutes before the final whistle after he dribbled past the Moroccan goalkeeper to put the ball
in the back of the empty net. 
 
"I told our players during half time that we need to play like we used to do. 
Once we played proper football on the ground we were able to score. After scoring the first goal, 
we had several chances and we were able to score the second goal, that’s normal.
" Al Ahly's head coach Pitso Mosimane told press after the game.  

The game saw the return of Ali Maaloul and 
Hamdy Fathy who participated in the second half of the game after being sidelined for a long time due to injuries.
