Kante named Man Of the Match in UEFA Champions League Final

CAIRO, 30 May 2021: Chelsea's Ngolo Kante was chosen as the best player in the Champions League final 
that brought his team together with Manchester City.
 
Chelsea beat Manchester City with a goal by Kai Havertz in the Champions League final.
 
Kante participated in the final in the full 90 minutes.
 
Kante won the man of the match award in the first-leg matches against Real Madrid in the semi-finals of the tournament.
 
Chelsea's victory added a new title to its Champions League locker after the 2012 title, in its third final, as it lost the 2008 edition to Manchester United.
 
Premier League champions City were favourites ahead of the final but suffered a desperately disappointing night
 in their first Champions League showpiece match.
Despite winning three of the last four Premier League titles for City, 
Spaniard Guardiola failed to deliver the coveted European trophy he last won with Barcelona in 2011.
